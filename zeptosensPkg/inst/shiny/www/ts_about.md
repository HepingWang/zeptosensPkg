Target Score is an under-development algorithm with the current website version of V1.0. Built by Augustin, Luna, Heping, Wang and Korkut Lab using R shiny.

# Data Attribution

We are extremely grateful to the data providers who have made this resource possible. Attribution for the data is listed below. All gene expression data is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project.

**Cancer proteomic data**

Proteomic datasets that capture the signaling relations within a biological context serve as the experimental constraint for network inference. Here, RPPA-based phospho-proteomics data from the TCGA project involving 32 cancer types, and more than 10,000 patients are used.

**Cell line-specific proteomic data**

The phospho-proteomic landscape of ~300 proteins within specific cell-lines was collected before and after the drug perturbation experiment. Here, the proteomic data was provided by Anil Korkut lab and the detailed information can be found in [Experiment details](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/711895v1).
