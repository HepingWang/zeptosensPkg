#question: distances from database or a SIF?
#question: Can (should) we create a new distances file for new data
#check pmatch vs. match in extracting the wks. MAke it all "match" and test. 
#number of rows returned in match for cbind.
# i <- inhibiting PTM.
# a <- activating PTM
#c <- total protein measurement (no specific PTM, includes everything)
#ts: integral_dose(fs*(xi+sigma_j(2^p*xj*product_k(wk))))
